# Best-City-Guide

In this project, I learned how to position an element using the different positioning techniques with relative, absolute, and fixed. I also learned how to stack elements with z-indexing, as well as how to create columns using the float property, creating a stick footer, and using the "clearfix" method to fix collapsed containers with floated items.
